Environment: Ubuntu 20.04 - VMWare WorkStation with libsfml-dev and build-essential installed

Each folder represents the the different part of the homework
Part1: decision_tree_Part1
Part2: behavior_tree
Part3 decision_tree_learning_part3 AND decision_tree_learning_process_data_part3

Part 1:
navigate to decision_tree_Part1 folder.
If there are *.o files, run command: make clean
compile with the Makefile and run command: make
run the program with command: ./main

Part 2:
navigate to behavior_tree folder.
If there are *.o files, run command: make clean
compile with the Makefile and run command: make
run the program with command: ./main

Part 3:
navigate to decision_tree_learning_process_data_part3 folder.
Verify if monster_state_data.txt exist. 
If it contains the monster_state_data.txt, compile with the Makefile and run command: make
run the program with command: ./main

If there is no monster_state_data.txt
navigate to decision_tree_learning_part3 folder. 
If there are *.o files, run command: make clean
compile with the Makefile and run command: make
if there is monster_state_data.txt in decision_tree_learning_part3 folder, delete it. 
run the program with command: ./main
Let the program run for at least 1 minute to generate enough data
Close the program. 
Check if there is a new monster_state_data.txt
If yes, move it to decision_tree_learning_process_data_part3 folder
and follow the step above.
